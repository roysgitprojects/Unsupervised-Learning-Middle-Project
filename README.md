# Abstract
Three data sets were analyzed using five unsupervised learning methods. The first data set is about online shoppers purchasing intention. The second one represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals of patients with diabetes. The third data set contains information on click-stream from online store offering clothing for pregnant women. For each data set, the goal was to cluster the data, visualize the clustering results, compute how well each clustering method fits the external classification, determine which clustering algorithms is better and explain the reason for the difference between them. Out of the five algorithms tested, Hierarchical Complete with four clusters was the best algorithm for the data of online shoppers intention and e-shop clothing. However, for the clinical data K Means with three clusters provided the best results.
